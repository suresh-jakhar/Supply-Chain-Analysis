## 🛠 Techniques & Tools Used

This project applies a range of techniques to analyze and visualize supply chain data. Here's a quick breakdown of what was used:

### 📋 Data Handling & Analysis
- Cleaned and explored the dataset using `pandas`
- Checked for null values, understood distributions, and summarized key stats

### 📊 Visualization
- Used **Plotly Express** and **Plotly Graph Objects** to build interactive charts:
  - Scatter plots (with trendlines)
  - Bar and pie charts
  - Histograms and box plots
  - Treemaps and other breakdown visuals
- Visuals include tooltips, filters, and color mapping for deeper insights

### 📉 Statistical Insight
- Added OLS trendlines in scatter plots to observe relationships between variables (like price vs revenue)

### 📦 Supply Chain Insights
- Revenue and cost analysis by product type
- Identified high-performing product categories and regional performance
- Looked at sales vs stock to get an idea of inventory flow

### 📚 Libraries Used
- `pandas` for data processing
- `plotly.express` and `plotly.graph_objects` for plotting
- `statsmodels` for regression overlays

All visuals are fully interactive and designed to help explore patterns, trends, and insights across the supply chain dataset.
